# GusAndEddyWebsite

A silly website to play bingo when you listen to the Gus and Eddy podcast. However, it is a full-stack application coded in React on the front-end and Express on the back-end. The backend is a REST API server and the URL to view this is [https://api.gusandeddybingo.com/bingo_Values](https://api.gusandeddybingo.com/bingo_Values).
